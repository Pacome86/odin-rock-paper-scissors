// Inputs: 
// The computer choose randomly between : "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
// Prompt the user to choose between: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

// Desired Output: 
// - A function called score that store the result of each round 
// for the computer and the player; then the higher score is returned:
// function playerRoundScore vs computerRoundScore (you win = +1, you lose = -1)

// - Function computerGameScore vs playerGameScore
// determine the winner after 5 round game that keeps score
// and reports a winner or looser at the end. 

// Pseudocode:
//  1- Write a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either 
//  "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

//  2- Write a function that play a single round of Rock Paper Scissors:

//      - The function called playRound should take 2 parameters 
//      (playerSelection and computerSelection).

//      -The function should return a string that declares the winner
//      of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".

//      - The function functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive 
//      (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).

//      - I want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() 
//      them; because I am going to use the return later on.

//  3- Test the function playRound by using console.log() to see the results:

        /* function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
            // your code here!
            }
 
            const playerSelection = "rock";
            const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
            console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)); */

//  4- Write a NEW function called game().Use the previous function {inside} of this one 
//  to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

//      - Call playRound function 5 times in a row (or use a loop).
//      - Use console.log() to display the result of each round and the winner at the end.
//      - Use prompt to get input from the user.
